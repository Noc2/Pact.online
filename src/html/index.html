        <h2>About Dweb.page</h2>
        <p>Dweb.page is an open source webpage that allows you to share and search content on the distributed web. It’s
          one of the first distributed websites running in your browser, meaning that you are in complete control of
          your data. We neither have access to your encrypted data nor can we prevent you from sharing and receiving
          this data. By design, it’s impossible to alter your data after the upload. Additionally, the integrated
          file explorer allows you to claim the ownership of your data and provides a transparent logging system. </p>
        <p>Currently, the service allows for the sharing of files up to 1GB. If you <a
            href='https://blog.florence.chat/tutorial-how-to-host-your-own-file-transfer-service-on-your-pc-22698c9d6362'
            target='_blank'>host it locally</a>, there won’t be an upload limit. The recipient can download the
          file for 3 days. </p>
        <p>If you choose the private mode, we recommend using two separate channels: <br>
          1) for sharing the file link and <br>
          2) for the password link. <br>
          To maximize security, consider using a channel you are confident only the intended receiver has access to.
          Usually, using email for the file link and WhatsApp for the password link works fine. </p>
        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>The website itself and files are uploaded on a distributed file system named <a href="https://ipfs.io/"
            target="_blank">IPFS</a>.
          Logs and metadata are stored on an immutable distributed ledger named <a href="https://www.iota.org/"
            target="_blank">IOTA</a>.
          IPFS allows files to be shared in an immutable and distributed way and IOTA makes sure that nobody can delete
          or alter the logs and metadata. Furthermore,
          we
          implemented the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/" target="_blank">Web Crypto API</a>
          (AES256-GCM) to fully encrypt the files inside your browser. The Web Crypto API (secp256r1) is also used to
          sign the transactions,
          and your signatures private key is not extractable stored inside your browser.</p>
        <p>The website itself is hosted on different servers, which you can also access directly in case someone blocks
          our service. If you open Dweb.page you will see a randomly selected version of the website. Uploaded files
          can be download from any <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/" target="_blank">IPFS
            gateway</a> or simply under the generated link.</p>
        <p>You can find the complete source code as well as our security whitepaper on Github: <a
            href="https://github.com/PACTCare/Dweb.page" target="_blank">https://github.com/PACTCare/Dweb.page</a>. </p>
        <h2>Participate</h2>
        <p>If you wish to participate you can simply set up your own IPFS node with a writeable gateway. You need
          to
          allow a maximum upload size on your server of 1GB. Lastly, reach out to us at info[at]pact[dot]care or on
          <a href="https://discord.gg/VMj7PFN" target="_blank">discord</a> so
          we then can integrate your side on our main page. Currently, we share the IOTA donations equally among
          all participants at the end of every month. For transparency, you can track all donations under the
          current <a
            href="https://thetangle.org/address/SSFQNEKDAMMAJSTMLRPIHSKZMHQTMYITPPLUWLOPYKS9K9YDGJZKTNQHJVD9YGZFOVZKAZHDIDMFWJGUY"
            target="_blank"> IOTA donation address</a>. In the future, we might set up an advertising model
          to make it more attractive for IPFS nodes to participate.
